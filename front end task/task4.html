    <p id ="1">
        The Flavian Amphitheatre, usually called the Colosseum or Coliseum, 
        is a spectacular amphitheatre constructed in Rome and inaugurated in AD. 80 by Titus, 
        the son of Vespasian, for a hundred days of games that included gladiatorial battles and animal contests. 
        It is one of the 7 Wonders of the World. Even though two-thirds of the original structure has been damaged 
        over time, it is one of the most well-known tourist locations.
